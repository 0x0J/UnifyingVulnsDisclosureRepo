# Reports

This part contains the reports covering the discovered Logitech Unifying vulnerabilities.

It should be noted, that Logitech and I agrred to hand in the reports in a "loose format/structure",
as there have been issues to identify a proper reporting mechanism in the beginning.
The reports have been sent directly to an engineering Team. My PoC kindly forwarded my questions and
concerns to the other Logitech departments (PR, LEGAL etc.), which helped to deal with all of this
in "responsible disclosure" fashion, even if no common disclosure platform was used.

Note: I removed Names of Logitech employees from the reports in this repo.

## Report 1 - report1_git.pdf

- covers PoC 1
- sniffing of pairing via RF
- calculate device keys from sniffed pairing
- eavesdrop and decrypt keyboard traffic (allows injecting keystrokes, too)
- other issues

## Report 2 - report2_git.pdf

- covers PoC 2
- counter re-use vulnerability (even if counter re-use issue reported by Bastille is patched)
- information leakage on plaintext of encrypted keystrokes
- brute-force encrypted RF frames for keystroke injection
- arbitrary keystroke injection without key knowledge and *one time* access to keyboard device


- eavesdrop and decrypt keyboard traffic (allows injecting keystrokes, too)
- other issues

## Report 3 - t.b.d

- will be added when patch is released, covers PoC 3
